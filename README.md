## Prerequisites

- Node
  - We recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) and running `nvm use` in this directory to sync with the project's Node version. However, if you wish to install Node your own way and ensure a consistent version with `.nvmrc`, that's fine too

## Setup

1. Install dependencies

```sh
yarn install
```

2. Set up Husky Hooks üêïÔ∏è

```sh
yarn prepare
```

### Database setup üêò

1. Set up `env` variables

```sh
cp .env.sample .env
```

Edit the .env file and set the database password

‚ö†Ô∏è DO NOT CHECK IN PASSWORDS OR ENV FILES INTO GITHUB. ALL SECRETS SHOULD BE MANAGED VIA GITHUB SECRETS

2. Install Docker Desktop (or ensure it is running)
   https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/

3. Run `docker compose up` to start the containers

## How to Test

1. Run `yarn dev`
2. Open your browser to http://localhost:3000/
3. Navigate to the Explorer section from the menu in the left pane.
4. Run the following query and confirm that you get a response with status code 200:

```
query ExampleQuery {
  names {
    ja,
    en
  }
}
```
