# findadoc-server

## Prerequisites

- Node
  - We recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) and running `nvm use` in this directory to sync with the project's Node version. However, if you wish to install Node your own way and ensure a consistent version with `.nvmrc`, that's fine too

## Setup

1. Install dependencies

```sh
yarn install
```

2. Set up Husky Hooks üêïÔ∏è

```sh
yarn prepare
```

### Database Setup üêò
0. Install Postgres (v14.5)
- on OS X
```sh
brew install postgresql
createuser -s postgres
brew services restart postgresql
```

1. Init the database
```sh
./init-db.sh
```

2. Set up `env` variables

```sh
cp .env.sample .env
```

Edit the .env file and set the database password

8. If you select a type that requires an ID (such as `Facility` or `HealthcareProfessional`) then add the ID in the "Variables" window at the bottom _as a string_.
