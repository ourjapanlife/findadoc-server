## Prerequisites

- Node 
  - We recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) and running `nvm use` in this directory to sync with the project's Node version. However, if you wish to install Node your own way and ensure a consistent version with `.nvmrc`, that's fine too

## Setup

1. Install dependencies
```sh
yarn install
```
2. Set up Husky Hooks üêïÔ∏è
```sh
yarn prepare
```
